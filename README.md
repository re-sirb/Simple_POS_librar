# Simple POS module for Python
A quick and dirty python module to utilize the ubiquitous Epson TM-T20III POS printer over USB. This is mainly intended for quick testing. It requires pyusb (to make it work on Windows), on Linux you can get rid of the USB_Printer class and instead use the device file directly.

For more information, I recommend reading Epson's ESC/POS Application Programming Guide.

Have fun!
